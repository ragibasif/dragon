# Dragon

Dragon is a library that provides tools for rapid prototyping. It is implemented
in C programming language and built for **educational and recreational purposes.**

This is a low-level C library designed for experienced developers. **No build
scripts, installation instructions, or documentation is provided.** You are
expected to understand how to integrate C libraries into your own build system
and link them manually as needed. As usage will vary greatly depending on the
target platform, tool chain, and integration context, **there are no release
build instructions or usage help messages.** You are expected to read the source
code to understand its behavior and adapt it to your environment.
